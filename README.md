# Whirled Session Exploit
There's a flash file that contains the flash file you can export as an SWF to receive session information on users that see the client. There's a PHP file that stores the session into the database. There's a SQL file that is the template to the database to store the session information.

# Configurations
You must change the URLRequest and Security Policy URL inside of the Flash file to the proper URL of the server you're running. Also, the server you run must also contain a crossdomain.xml file that the Security Policy loads, which a template crossdomain.xml is provided here.

# How I Discovered The Exploit
Originally, my session exploit would read into the flash vars and that was great and working. Until, a developer on Synced Online patched that system and decided to use JavaScript cookies instead. I tried to use ExternalInterface in ActionScript to access the JavaScript cookies, but it didn't work on my avatar.

I later discovered that to use ExternalInterface I had to not create an avatar with the Whirled classpaths, so I was able to receive the cookies!
